# Gaming-Gallery

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a gallery of games I'm playing and test out some of the things I have been learning in CSS. The project will start out as a single web page and showcase 5 games I have some experience in. I will include an image, title, platform I'm using, and description for each game. At the top, I will include the title of the page and a few links to navigate to each corresponding game on the page.
