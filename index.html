    <!-- Description of my gaming experience -->
    <section>
        <h2>My Gaming Experience</h2>
        <p>I have played games for a few years now, mostly on my desktop and phone. The games I usually play come with
            customization features. This could be through character creation, skillsets, or gear. The genres I normally
            go
            for include action, mmorpg, fantasy, adventure, free-to-play, gacha, single-player, and obviously character
            customization. I have also tried shooters, survival and horror, fighting, and rhythm. Although I have tried
            a
            variety of games, I am a casual gamer who does not compete with others. I merely take my time and enjoy
            exploring the gaming worlds through single-player modes. Below are five of the games that I am currently
            playing.</p>
