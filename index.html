    <!-- Description of my gaming experience -->
    <p>I have played games for a few years now, mostly on my desktop and phone. The games I usually play come with
        customization features. This could be through character creation, skillsets, or gear. The genres I normally go
        for include action, mmorpg, fantasy, adventure, free-to-play, gacha, single-player, and obviously character
        customization. I have also tried shooters, survival and horror, fighting, and rhythm. Although I have tried a
        variety of games, I am a casual gamer who does not compete with others. I merely take my time and enjoy
        exploring the gaming worlds through single-player modes. Below are five of the games I am currently playing.</p>
